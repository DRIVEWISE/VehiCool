# Examples

This directory contains detailed examples of how to use the `VehiCool` library.

## Test data

The directory [`data`](data) contains a set of test data files that can be used to test the library. The files are:



## Basic usage

The directory [`basic_usage`](basic_usage) contains a set of basic examples of how to use the library.

### Example 1: single-body object with a following camera in post-processing

The file [`example_1.m`](basic_usage/example_1.m) shows how to use the library to create a simple object and animate it in post-processing.

### Example 2: single-body object with a following camera in real-time

The file [`example_2.m`](basic_usage/example_2.m) shows how to use the library to create a simple object and animate it in “real-time” (i.e., one step at a time, as if it was attached to a simulation).

### Example 3: single-body object with a trajectory and a following camera in post-processing

The file [`example_3.m`](basic_usage/example_3.m) shows how to use the library to create a simple object and animate it in post-processing, while plotting a static trajectory.

### Example 4: single-body object with a fixed camera in post-processing

The file [`example_4.m`](basic_usage/example_4.m) shows how to use the library to create a simple object and animate it in post-processing, while using a fixed camera.

## Advanced usage

The directory [`advanced_usage`](advanced_usage) contains a set of advanced examples of how to use the library.

### Example 1: multi-body system with a following camera in post-processing

The file [`example_1.m`](advanced_usage/example_1.m) shows how to use the library to create a simple multi-body system and animate it in post-processing.

### Example 2: multi-body system with a following camera in real-time

The file [`example_2.m`](advanced_usage/example_2.m) shows how to use the library to create a simple multi-body system and animate it in “real-time” (i.e., one step at a time, as if it was attached to a simulation).
